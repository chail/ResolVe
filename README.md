# ResolVe

An Arduino Program to coordinate an Xray generator, Xray detector, motion controller, and manual switch to take xray images in a customized pattern over a 2-D plane. This was my Senior Design Project.

1 in 9 women will develop breast cancer in her lifetime – and the survival rate is largely determined by detection stage. With a 98% and 27% five-year survival rate for early and late detection, respectively, early detection is critical. The highest current clinical standard is 3D Mammography. This standardized process images all patients in the same way by taking a series of 2D x-ray images along the chest wall, often yielding inconclusive results.

RESOLVE’s innovative approach takes advantage of a prototype system that can image anywhere above the plane of the breast in both the x- and y-directions, allowing us to develop a personalized breast cancer imaging system that automatically images patients with consideration to their unique breast geometry. Using edge detection and customized image acquisition scripts, we evaluated 67 different imaging patterns. By imaging digital phantoms, we demonstrated that our customized patterns rank consistently better than both the current chest wall method and the respective non-custom patterns. Specifically, our Custom V pattern can successfully resolve a 100-micron simulated mass that resembles the smallest microcalcifications – one of the earliest signs of breast cancer. Furthermore, we have successfully automated image acquisition with a single-button press, using a microcontroller to coordinate the various components of the prototype system to decrease both repetition and scan time. We have demonstrated proof-of-concept for both the customization and automation aspects of RESOLVE – and in the future, we hope to further optimize our imaging patterns and integrate both components to create a streamlined process for personalized 3D breast cancer screenings.
